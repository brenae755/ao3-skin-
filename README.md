!!SUPER IMPORTANT!!
you have to change the ao3 site wizard in order to change the font as well as some buttons, I put the site wizard settings here:
    Font:'Palatino' / Percent of browser font size:110%  / Vertical gap between paragraphs:1.3em / Background color:#7A1524 /  Text color:#FCCCE0 /  Header     color:#93a3cf /  Accent color:#340914
